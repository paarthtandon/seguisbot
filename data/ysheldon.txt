 Matt Hobby was promoted to the main cast starting with the third season
 Jim Parsons, who portrays the adult Sheldon Cooper on The Big Bang Theory, narrates the series and serves as an executive producer
Development of the prequel series began in November 2016, from an initial idea that Parsons passed along to The Big Bang Theory producers

 Premise The series takes place in the late 1980s and early 1990s and follows Sheldon Cooper as a young boy attending high school in the fictional town of Medford, Texas
 As a nine-year-old boy (in the first season) attending high school, he tries to fit into the world full of people, including his own family and friends, who do not quite know how to deal with his unique intellectual capabilities and social ineptitude
Date references are made within the series to anchor the series' time setting
 In the series premiere, adult Sheldon states "nobody I knew in East Texas in 1989 cared about Newtonian physics"
 Sheldon's journal featured in ""A Patch, a Modem, and a Zantac®" was dated November 9, 1989
 The second season makes a couple of references to 1990
 In episode 11 of that season there is an event called the "1990 East Texas Baptist Olympics", and in the season finale Sheldon is listening to a Nobel Prize announcement which can be inferred to have happened in October 1990
 Episode 11 of season two has ALF, a series that ran from 1986 until 1990, featured on the television
 In episode 4 of the fourth season, Missy references the song "Ice Ice Baby", implying most likely early 1991
 In episode 14 of the fourth season, it's revealed that Sheldon, who's now 11, has been filing the family taxes for the past 2 years
 With Sheldon at age 9 in 1989, this implies the episode is set in 1991

 Episodes  Production  Development In November 2016, it was reported that CBS was in negotiations to create a spin-off of The Big Bang Theory centered on Sheldon Cooper as a young boy
 The prequel series, described as "a Malcolm in the Middle-esque single-camera family comedy" would be executive produced by The Big Bang Theory co-creator Chuck Lorre and producer Steven Molaro, with The Big Bang Theory co-creator Bill Prady expected to be involved in some capacity, and intended to air in the 2017–18 season alongside The Big Bang Theory
 The initial idea for the series came from Jim Parsons (who portrays the older Sheldon on The Big Bang Theory), who passed it along to The Big Bang Theory producers
 On March 13, 2017, CBS ordered the spin-off Young Sheldon series, which was created by Lorre and Molaro
 Jon Favreau directed and executive produced the pilot
 Parsons, Lorre, Molaro and Todd Spiewak also serve as executive producers on the series, for Chuck Lorre Productions, Inc
 in association with Warner Bros

 Overlap with the parent series In most cases different actors are used to portray a given character in the two series, to account for the age difference
 Jim Parsons is a notable exception in that he appears in both series as the same character, though in this series his appearance is limited to voice only
 In the Season 4 episode "Graduation", Mayim Bialik (as Amy, the wife of Adult Sheldon) has a brief voiceover role while Sheldon describes the graduation party for their son Leonard, whom he reveals was named after Leonard Hofstadter and Leonard Nimoy
 Bob Newhart appears as Professor Proton in both series; with the appearance in this series the character is made to look younger
 Iain Armitage (Sheldon), Lance Barber (George), and Montana Jordan (Georgie) make a guest appearance in the parent series in a scene in which a VHS tape recorded decades earlier is played
 There are other actors who appear in both series but as different characters
 This includes Barber, who had another guest appearance in the parent series as a different character, and Kaley Cuoco who stars in the parent series and makes an uncredited voice appearance in this series, voicing an inanimate object
 Elon Musk makes cameo appearances as himself in both series
The second-season finale episode aired immediately following the one-hour series finale of the parent series
 In a tribute to the parent series finale, several references are made to the parent series in the Young Sheldon episode
 The references are both general to the entire parent series, as well as to the series finale in particular
 In one scene in the Young Sheldon episode, Sheldon promises his father that when he wins the Nobel Prize, Sheldon will mention him in his acceptance speech
 In the parent series finale, Sheldon wins the Nobel Prize
 In another scene in the Young Sheldon episode, Nobel Prize winners are announced out over a montage showing the main characters from the parent series Leonard, Penny, Raj, Howard, Bernadette and Amy as children
 Christine Baranski and Carol Ann Susi, who respectively portray Leonard's mother and Howard's mother in the parent series, make a voice appearance in the montage (a posthumous appearance in the case of Susi)
 Following the montage, adult Sheldon says that he was wrong about feeling at the moment of the Nobel prize announcement that he would be all alone for the rest of his life
 Title sequence The show's title sequence is played to the song "Mighty Little Man" by Steve Burns
 The song is the first track in Burns' 2003 album Songs for Dustmites
 The title sequence was changed in Season 3 to include the entire Cooper family
 Prior to Season 3, the title sequence only showed Sheldon
 Along with adding the entire Cooper family, season 3 also made some of the opening sequences unique by having Sheldon dress up in different costumes for different episodes
